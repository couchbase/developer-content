= Couchbase Server Quickstart - Upsert and Lookup via Ottoman 2.6 & NodeJS SDK 2.6
:imagesdir: ../assets/images
:sourcedir: ../examples

[abstract]
Before we get started with Ottoman and Node JS, we need to ensure you have Couchbase up and running. We will create a data bucket and two indexes for basic queries. Using Couchbase's N1QL query syntax, we will create two indexes, a primary and adaptive index. After we upsert our records, these indexes will allow us to look up our documents with the Query API in Ottoman. 

== Prerequisites: Three Steps required to Query our Bucket

1. Setup Couchbase Server 6.5 and ensure it is running.

2. Create an empty bucket named "default".

3. Add a primary and adaptive index for our default bucket.

If you still need to perform these tasks please use one of the following:

== Step 1: Create The Ottoman Node JS Project

In this exercise, we will be working with the link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/node-ottoman[Ottoman 2.6 ODM (Object Document Mapper)] in conjunction with the link:https://docs.couchbase.com/nodejs-sdk/2.6/start-using-sdk.html[NodeJS SDK v2.6.11] or any minor version that is higher will do. I'm using Node JS version 12.14 and NPM version 6.13, you can find these version numbers for Node and NPM by running the following command:

```sh
node --version
npm --version
```

NOTE: you can get to the Couchbase Server Web UI at any time by visiting link:https://localhost:8091[localhost:8091]. 

Let's first create a project directory named `first-query-ottoman`, change directories into that directory and initialize NPM:

```sh
mkdir first-query-ottoman && cd $_ && npm init
```

NOTE: The double ampersands (`&&`)are just a way of chaining multiple shell commands. The `$_` command simply captures our last used argument which in our case was the directory that we created.

Now with a node package manager and manifest (`package.json`) in place, let's add Couchbase and ottoman to our dependencies for the project:

```sh
npm install couchbase ottoman
```

Now we will create a file named `server.js` and launch Visual Studio Code:

```sh
touch server.js && code .
```

This command has set up a project directory and enabled npm, installed `couchbase` and `ottoman` as well as created a `server.js` file and finally opened up our VS Code editor to the project root. 

Open `server.js` file, this is where we'll add our code.

Taking each code sample below, we will add each new block of code done after one another.

== Connecting to a Couchbase Bucket

Create a connection to our Couchbase Server running in Docker. Your password may be different, just swap out yours if it is different.

```js
var ottoman = require('ottoman')
var couchbase = require('couchbase')

var cluster = new couchbase.Cluster('localhost:8091')

cluster.authenticate('Administrator', 'password')
ottoman.bucket = cluster.openBucket('default')
```

== Creating an Ottoman Model

Create a model for our `User` document. It will get auto-created and stored in our already created `default` bucket in Couchbase. Once our model is set up, we can add a few initial documents to populate our bucket.

```js
var User = ottoman.model('User', {
  firstName: 'string',
  lastName: 'string',
  email: 'string',
  tagline: 'string'
})
```

Ottoman does support other data types like `boolean`, integer`, and `Date`. A model can also define indexes similar to the ones we set up manually. For now, we are going to skip letting Ottoman set up our indexes as we already have them in place.

== Create New User Documents

Here we are defining a few documents that we want to persist to our bucket, notice we are using the same document that we defined in our model.

```js
var user_perry = new User({
  firstName: 'Perry',
  lastName: 'Mason',
  email: 'perry.mason@acme.com',
  tagLine : 'Who can we get on the case?'
})
var user_tom = new User({
  firstName: 'Major',
  lastName: 'Tom',
  email: 'major.tom@acme.com',
  tagLine : 'Send me up a drink'
})
var user_jerry = new User({
  firstName: 'Jerry',
  lastName: 'Wasaracecardriver',
  email: 'jerry.wasaracecardriver@acme.com',
  tagLine : 'el sob number one'
})
```

== Persist Documents to Our Bucket

Call Ottoman's `save()` method on each of these objects which will add them to our database so long as no errors occur.

```js
user_perry.save((err) => {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log(`success: user ${user_perry.firstName} added!`)
})
user_tom.save((err) => {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log(`success: user ${user_tom.firstName} added!`)
})
user_jerry.save((err) => {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log(`success: user ${user_jerry.firstName} added!`)
})
```

Now that we have added the code to save (persist) each record to the database, let's run our app for the first time with Node:

```sh
node server
```

You should get three success messages in the console.

```sh
success: user Perry added!
success: user Major added!
success: user Jerry added!
```

If we open our Web UI at link:https://localhost:8091[localhost:8091] and navigate to the "Buckets" tab, we can see that two records were added to the `default` bucket. 

NOTE: You can edit the document in place by clicking the pencil icon or remove them individually with the trash icon. You can also edit the buckets and in the section "Advanced bucket settings" enable Flush. When flushed, all items in the bucket are removed. This is a quick way to remove all documents.

Let's remove these three documents, write some more code that will add the documents, and then turn around and query them.

== Write a Query with Ottoman's Query API

In Ottoman, we can retrieve records from our bucket using the adaptive index we have in place by calling the `find()` method.

```js
User.find({ lastName: 'Tom' }, { consistency: ottoman.Consistency.LOCAL },
  (err, items) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('Query results: ', items)
  }
);
```

The first two arguments to the `find()` method are `filter` and `options`. 

Instead of passing objects along as parameters, let's write our code to define the filter and options as objects first and then pass them into the function as arguments.

```js
var filters = { 
  lastName: 'Tom'
}

var options = {
  consistency: ottoman.Consistency.LOCAL
}

User.find(filters, options,
  (err, items) => {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log('Query Result: ', items)
  }
)
```

NOTE: If we had a lot more data and we were expecting hundreds of records to be returned, we could page the results with our options to get the second page (pagination), like this:

```js
var options = {
  limit: 10,
  skip: 10
  consistency: ottoman.Consistency.LOCAL
}
```

Let's run Node again and now we should get the same three success messages and an object returned to us that we queried for:

```sh
node server
```

You should see results similar to the following in your command line:

```sh
success: user Perry added!
success: user Major added!
success: user Jerry added!
Query results:  [
  User {
    _id: '7dac3b61-a83f-4374-a545-c1fda64f17de',
    firstName: 'Major',
    lastName: 'Tom',
    email: 'major.tom@acme.com',
    tagLine: 'Send me up a drink'
  }
]
```

NOTE: In our case indexes were added manually, if not Ottoman would have given us this error message:

```sh
"errors": [
  {
    "code": 4000,
    "msg": "No index available on keyspace default that matches your query. Use CREATE INDEX or CREATE PRIMARY INDEX to create an index, or check that your expected index is online."
  }
]
```

== Summary

We have created models in Ottoman, defined some documents, and persisted them to the database. We then subsequently looked them up using the built-in `find()` method which used the Ottoman Query API for Couchbase. We have not yet touched on indexes other than the fact that we created two of them during the docker and indexes section of the quickstart.

== Exercise Complete

Congratulations! You have engaged with the world's most powerful JSON document database by using Ottoman. Know that our query language N1QL was run under the hood too but we did not have to write any N1QL, you can learn more about it with our link:https://query-tutorial.couchbase.com/tutorial[N1QL Tutorial] if you are interested in exploring our query language for Couchbase.
